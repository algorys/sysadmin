# Introduction

Alignak is a monitoring framework. It is used to check your IT (or over) and to keep you informed about problems and performance degradation (mail, SMS, XMPPâ€¦). It can be used from small environments to very large (multi-datacenter, fail-over, load-balancing).

**WARNING:** Alignak is still under development and may be unstable ! The first release is however very close.

During this tutorial, we'll install Alignak and its satellites, who are written mainly in Python. Those applications require a minimum knowledge with Linux and to be resourceful.

It can come in addition to the demo tutorial provided by the Alignak team: [Alignak Demo](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-demo).

Almost all of Alignak's repositories have stable versions available via `pip`. But I'll try to provide each repository URL each time you install a new software.

# Prerequisites

> **Note:** This tutorial was performed on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server. Other Linux are also compatible.

## Mandatory Requirements

First of all, like all installation, you need to have a server up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Then some tools are needed and obviously Python. Main satellites of Alignak are only compatible with Python 2.7 ! So if you have Python 3 installed, be sure `python` command is linked to Python 2.7.

Let's install:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git 
sudo apt-get install python2.7 python2.7-dev python-pip

# Needed for the PyOpenSSL / Cryptography dependencies of Alignak
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev
```

It is recommended also to upgrade default pip:

```bash
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Optional Requirements

This tutorial currently use **screen** because the scripts provided by Alignak use it:

```bash
sudo apt-get install screen
```

Here is some screen hint and tips to help you later:

```bash
# Listing the active screens
screen -ls

# Joining a screen
screen -r alignak-backend

# Leaving a screen (without killing it)
screen -r alignak-backend
Ctrl a+d

# Switching between active screens
Ctrl a+n
```

# Alignak Base

> **Note:** You've to know that all Alignak components need a root account (or sudo privileges) to get installed.

Alignak need also an **alignak** user. Don't create it yet, we'll create after with a script.

Many components will be installed with pip, only Framework is installed with Git. If you want to install from the repository also, it is recommended to use only **develop branch**. We try to make sure that the develop branch is always as stable as possible !

## Alignak Framework

> **Repos:** [Alignak](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring/alignak)

Download the repository and install it:

```bash
mkdir ~/repos; cd ~/repos

# Alignak framework
git clone https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring/alignak
cd alignak/
# Install alignak and all its python dependencies
# -v will activate the verbose mode of pip
sudo pip install -v .
```

Pay attention to the end message,  it will already give you a lot of indications on what is good or not.

As you can see, alignak does not found **alignak** user / group and say also that you've to set some permissions on specific folders.

To correct this, run the following script:

```bash
sudo ./dev/set_permissions.sh
```

You'll have the following output:

```bash
Checking / creating 'alignak' user and users group
Checking / creating 'nagios' users group
Adding group `nagios' (GID 117) ...
Done.
Adding user 'alignak' to the nagios users group
Adding user `alignak' to group `nagios' ...
Adding user alignak to group nagios
Done.
Setting 'alignak' ownership on: /usr/local/etc/alignak
Setting 'alignak' ownership on: /usr/local/var/run/alignak
Setting 'alignak' ownership on: /usr/local/var/log/alignak
Setting 'alignak' ownership on: /usr/local/var/lib/alignak
Setting 'alignak' ownership on: /usr/local/var/libexec/alignak
Setting file permissions on: /usr/local/etc/alignak
Terminated
```

That's all for the framework.

## Alignak Backend

> **Repos:** [Alignak Backend](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-backend)

The backend of Alignak is the heart of solution. To run it, you'll need to have a running Mongo database (see above).

To install alignak-backend:

```bash
sudo pip install alignak-backend
```

You can also install the **alignak-backend-import** tool. Alignak-backend-import will be used to import your config files after.

> **Repos:** [Alignak Backend Import](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-backend-import)

```bash
sudo pip install alignak-backend-import
```

### Mongo

To install MongoDB, you can find more informations on [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/).

But here is how to do that on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
sudo service mongod start
```

## Alignak Webui

> **Repos:** [Alignak WebUI](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-webui)

The WebUI is the the web interface for Alignak monitoring framework. To install it, run the followng command:

```bash
sudo pip install alignak-webui
```

In fact, if you want to use alignak you're yet ready. But alignak still has many components that are useful.

# Checks

> **Note:** You do not have to **install all the checks** below. Take what you are interested in and match your infrastructure.

This commands will be used to check the status of your services and each have a syntax of their own !

The most known is [Nagios Plugins](https://www.nagios.org/projects/nagios-plugins/). You can find a tutorial on this website on how install and use them and also for SNMP plugins:

* [Install Nagios and SNMP plugins](/2016/12/install-nagios-and-snmp-plugins)

There are many other checks available for each protocol on Alignak organization:

```bash
# Checks hosts thanks to NRPE Nagios active checks protocol
sudo pip install alignak-checks-nrpe

# Checks hosts thanks to old plain SNMP protocol
sudo pip install alignak-checks-snmp

# Checks hosts with "open source" Nagios plugins (eg. check_http, check_tcp, ...)
sudo pip install alignak-checks-monitoring

# Checks mysql database server
sudo pip install alignak-checks-mysql

# Checks Windows passively checked hosts/services (NSClient++ agent)
# As of now, use ==1.0rc1 to get the correct version
sudo pip install alignak-checks-windows-nsca

# Checks Windows with Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation
sudo pip install alignak-checks-wmi
```

You can add later if necessary.

# Alignak Modules

Alignak modules add some features to Alignak Framework. Some are necessary for the essential alignak features (like retention or logs), others are fully optionnal.

## Backend Module

> **Repos:** [Alignak Module Backend](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-module-backend)

The Alignak module Backend is needed for retention, logs, timeseries, ...

```bash
sudo pip install alignak-module-backend
```

## Logs Module

> **Repos:** [Alignak Logs Backend](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-module-logs)

The logs module add some logs for all monitoring events: alerts, notifications... This module is very usefull.

```bash
sudo pip install alignak-module-logs
```

## Notifications

> **Repos:** [Alignak Notifications](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-notifications)

This package will add some command to send notifications via email, XMPP, ... This is usefull if you want to be prevent when something goes wrong or not:

```bash
sudo pip install alignak-notifications
```

## Other Modules

> **Repos:** The following modules are all available under [Alignak Contrib](https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/) organization.

These modules add other commands or services.

```bash
# Collect passive NSCA checks
sudo pip install alignak-module-nsca
# Write external commands (Nagios-like) to a local named file
sudo pip install alignak-module-external-commands
# Notify external commands though a WS and get Alignak state with your web browser
sudo pip install alignak-module-ws
# Improve NRPE checks
sudo pip install alignak-module-nrpe-booster
```

# Configure Alignak

Now you normally have everything you need to get started.

As you will see, most of the configuration will be located in `/usr/local/etc`. Inside this folder, you'll find the _alignak_, _alignak-backend_ and _alignak-webui_ folders.

Other will install there configuration files inside `/usr/local/etc/alignak` (like alignak-notification for example). With this system alignak developers want the configuration of Alignak and its satellites to be centralized maximum.

> **Note:** All alignak configuration files are widely commented and detailed for each options ! Read carefully before making any changes.

## Check Installation

Perform these checks before.

For Python packages:

```bash
# The main packages you must have:
pip list --format=columns | grep alignak
alignak                0.2        
alignak-backend        0.8.17     
alignak-backend-client 0.9.0      
alignak-backend-import 0.9.0      
alignak-module-backend 0.5.0      
alignak-module-logs    0.5.1      
alignak-notifications  0.3.1      
alignak-webui          0.8.3.4 
```

For alignak folders:

```bash
ls -la /usr/local/etc/
total 20
drwxr-xr-x  5 root    root    4096 May  4 07:04 .
drwxr-xr-x 11 root    root    4096 May  4 06:44 ..
drwxrwxr-x  6 alignak alignak 4096 May  4 08:01 alignak
drwxr-xr-x  2 root    root    4096 May  4 07:04 alignak-backend
drwxr-xr-x  2 root    root    4096 May  4 07:04 alignak-webui

ls -la /usr/local/etc/alignak
total 44
drwxrwxr-x 6 alignak alignak 4096 May  4 08:01 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root    root    4096 May  4 07:04 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root    root    6445 Jan 29 21:20 alignak.backend-run.cfg
-rw-rw-r-- 1 alignak alignak 7756 May  4 06:44 alignak.cfg
-rw-rw-r-- 1 alignak alignak 3808 May  4 06:44 alignak.ini
drwxrwxr-x 8 alignak alignak 4096 May  4 06:44 arbiter
drwxrwxr-x 2 alignak alignak 4096 May  4 06:44 certs
drwxrwxr-x 2 alignak alignak 4096 May  4 06:44 daemons
drwxrwxr-x 3 alignak alignak 4096 May  4 06:44 sample

ls -la /usr/local/var/log/
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 5 root    root    4096 May  4 07:04 .
drwxr-xr-x 6 root    root    4096 May  4 06:44 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 alignak alignak 4096 May  4 06:44 alignak
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 May  4 07:04 alignak-backend
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 May  4 07:04 alignak-webui
```

As you can see some files in alignak folder miss _alignak_ user / group and the same thing for **log** folder.

To solve that, run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/repos/alignak
sudo ./dev/set_permissions.sh
sudo chown alignak:alignak /usr/local/var/log/alignak*
```

Now your installation is `OK` !

We'll begin by Backend and WebUI folder who are the more simple.

## Configure Backend

You will find 2 files in backend folder:

* uwsgi.ini
* settings.json

Right now, just edit the following file:

```bash
sudo vi /usr/local/etc/alignak-backend/uwsgi.ini
```

In this file you can see that backend is by default on `0.0.0.0:5000`. You can change IP and Port but don't forget after to report this change to other files !

The JSON file contains others configurations essentially for Bakcend data, Mongo or Timeseries.

## Configure WebUI

In WebUI Folder, you'll find 3 files:

* uwsgi.ini
* settings.cfg
* logging.json

Open the `uwsgi.ini` file. You will see that this file looks much like the backend. WebUI is on `0.0.0.0:5001` by default. Personnaly I prefer to use port 80, so:

```conf
http-socket = 0.0.0.0:80
```

Then open `settings.cfg` the WebUI configuration file. If you've modify IP and port of your WebUI, report your chnage here. The same for backend:

```ini
[bottle]
host = 0.0.0.0
port = 80

; If you've change backend IP:PORT, search and uncomment alignak_backend line
; alignak_backend = http://127.0.0.1:5000

; If you installed Web Service module, do the same.
; alignak_backend = http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

There is many options available to customize your WebUI.

The last file if for log formatting. You can have a look if you want, but it is not necessary to modify it.
