# Opening

The idea for this blog came when I was brought up to install several Open Source applications to inventory, manage and monitor computer equipment.

Most services provide a non-negligible quality for a "Sysadmin".

This kind of projects require a lot of investment and time ... and regular documentation is not necessarily easy to maintain by their creators.

# Goal

The purpose of this website is to centralize information for those applications, as their installation, latest releases or latest features.

On this site, you will find everything you need to help inventory, manage, automate and monitor your infrastructure. The goal is also to bring a "synergy" in your park for all those applications communicate together and share their data.
