# Opening

The idea for this blog came when I was brought up to install several Open Source servers to manage, monitor inventory and computer equipment .

Most services provide a non-negligible quality for a "Sysadmin".

This kind of projects require a lot of investment and time ... and regular documentation is not necessarily easy to maintain for their creators.

# Goal

The purpose of this website is to centralize information from these servers, as their installation, last releases or their latest features.

On this site, you will find everything you need to help manage, automate and monitor your infrastructure. The goal is also to bring a "synergy" in your park for all those servers can communicate together and share their data.
