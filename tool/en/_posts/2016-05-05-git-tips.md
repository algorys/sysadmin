# Introduction

This article offers some tips for `git`. Today, git is an essential program to know as a developper or a sysadmin. Many open source projects use [Github](https://github.com) today and can be download with it. That's why it's important to know some basics command.

The [Official Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) still a good point to start !

# Install Git

To install **git** you have just to install from packages in Linux:

[Linux commands](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

On Windows and other OS, just download and install it:

[Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once install, open a terminal and type following command to see if it's install:

```bash
git --version
```

# Before use Git

Before you use git, ensure you have read [this article](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). It explain what git does and in which case it's usefull.

# Configure git before first use:

To begin, you have to configure git, like your mail or your name. This is essential information which git needs so he can sign and commit properly.

Type following commands and replace informations with yours:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Lastname Firstname"
git config --global user.email "mymail@mail.com"
```

> **Note:** the option `--global` set configuration for all git repositories. If not use, it'll set only for current repository.

For future _commits_, you can set an editor:

```bash
# On Linux: choose as you want "vim", "nano", "gedit"
git config --global core.editor vim
# On Windows for notepad++
git config --global core.editor \
"'C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
```

Normally, git as all he need to works.

# Basics Commands

Here is the commands you have to know. They are the base of `git` and are very essential to use git in a repository (or call `repos` sometimes).

  1. Initialize a repos: `git init`
  2. See state of repos: `git status`
  3. Add files to repos: `git add myfile.txt myfolder/`
  4. Commit changes    : `git commit`

If you want to see changes before `add` or before `commit`, use `diff`:

```bash
# See changes before add
git diff
# See changes who's already added
git diff --cached
```

# Aliases

Alias are very usefull. Especially for long `git` commands. Here is some usefull alias I recommend:

```bash
# For checkout:
git config --global alias.ck 'checkout'
# For status
git config --global alias.s 'status --short'
# For pretty log
git config --global alias.lg 'log --oneline --graph --decorate --branches --all'
```

After just use alias like a command:

```bash
# Example for "lg"
git lg
```

# Cool prompt

In Linux, you can have name of your branch in terminal. You have to replace lines in your `~/.bashrc` file. Open it and search for following lines (on Debian-like distributions):

```conf
if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
else
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
fi
unset color_prompt force_color_prompt
```

And comment it with `#`. Then paste following lines above:

```conf
# Add git branch if its present to PS1
parse_git_branch() {
 git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}
if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
 PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[01;31m\]$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\]\$ '
else
 PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w$(parse_git_branch)\$ '
fi
unset color_prompt force_color_prompt
```

Open a new terminal and go back to your repository folder. You will see something like that:

```conf
user@host:~/workspace/repos(master)$
```

# Conclusion

Git is a very complex program and can be configured as you want. This tips are just here to help and find usefull commands. There is a lot of other possibilities. I'll had new tips if needed.
