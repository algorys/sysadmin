# Introduction

Puppet, from Puppet Labs, is a tool that helps administrators automate the provisioning, configuration and management of their network infrastructure. Using this kind of tool reduces the time spent on core tasks often repetitive and ensures consistency of your infrastructure.

Puppet is available in two versions: Puppet Puppet Enterprise and Open Source. It works with a system Agents associated with a master server.

This tutorial is based on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-puppet-to-manage-your-server-infrastructure). That's why I recommend to you to read this post instead of a new tutorial here.
